# Chat Semantic Search

> ✉️ I was trying to make  a semantic chat search tool for telegram, this is as far as I've gotten for the moment, the results aren't great, it's just a proof of concept that I'm still going to be working on over the winter holidays.

This repo is a Frankenshtein of the [pgai](https://github.com/timescale/pgai) project and [Telegram MTProto API client in Go](https://github.com/gotd/td) just used to parse some telegram messages from a user into a database, and then some tests that I was doing with the telegram vectorizers.

It's written in go, because go is fun, I might give it another go, I'll tweak some vectorizer parameters or maybe try using another vectorizer database. I'll make my findings more clear in some kind of blogpost at [mikedegeofroy.com](https://mikedegeofroy.com).
